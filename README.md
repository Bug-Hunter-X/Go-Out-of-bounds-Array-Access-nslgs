This repository demonstrates a common error in Go: out-of-bounds array access. The `bug.go` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.go` provides the corrected version.  The error occurs due to an off-by-one error in the loop's condition, resulting in a panic at runtime.  The solution adjusts the loop's condition to avoid accessing elements beyond the array's bounds. This example highlights the importance of careful index management when working with arrays and slices in Go.
